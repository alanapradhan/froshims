		<a name="intro"></a><b><u><h2>Introduction</h2></u></b> 
			The following web page introduces you to the Frosh IMs program for the Class of 2012. This 
information is not exhaustive, nor is it immutable. We present this guide as simply a framework for the way the Frosh IMs 
program will operate this year. We want the Frosh IMs program to be a meaningful part of your first year here at Harvard and 
so we gratefully welcome any suggestions for additional activities or other ways in which we can make the program better for 
you! Therefore, the information in this guide, especially regarding the events that we will offer this year, is subject to 
change.<br><br> 
 
			We hope that this year will be an excellent one for you, and that the Frosh IMs program will be one 
of your many enjoyable memories of this first year! So, get involved and have fun!<br><br><br></h4> 
 
			<b><u><h2><a name="mission"></a>Frosh IMs and its 
Mission</h2></u></b> 
			<h4 align="justify">Frosh IMs is first and foremost about 
fun! We want this program to be a way for 
freshmen to take part in athletic endeavors with a relaxed atmosphere! The emphasis is not upon winning and losing, but 
rather upon participation by all and building a camaraderie among the Class of 2012. Frosh IMs can be an excellent way to 
foster spirit within your dorm or entryway, and in the past many friendships have been made on the IM fields. We also hope 
that you will take advantage of the opportunities to try new sports this year. No experience is necessary for any of our 
activities - feel free to give it a shot! Almost all of our activities are also found in the House IM program, so we hope 
that this year will give you a taste of the many athletic opportunities you will have over the next four years!<br><br> 
		
			Best of luck with your first year here at Harvard! Remember, participation is the key! Get out there 
and have some fun!<br><br><br></h4> 
 
		<h2><b><u><a name="charge"></a>Those In Charge</u></b></h2> 
		<h4 align="justify">The Frosh IMs program is overseen and funded by 
the Freshman Dean's Office. The Harvard 
Department of Athletics, under the leadership of Tim Wheaton and Jennifer Carney, is in charge of the facilities used by all intramural 
programs and also is responsible for providing the officiating for all events.<br><br> 
	
		<b>Brandon Edwards - Director of Freshman Programming</b><br><br> 
		The Freshman Intramural Program program is pleased to have Brandon Edwards (bedwards@fas), Director of Freshman 
Programming in the Freshman Dean's Office. He is responsible for many of the programs you 
will participate in this year as freshman and will be overseeing the overall functioning of the program.<br><br> 
 
		<b>Undergraduate Directors</b><br><br> 
		For the past eight years, a number of undergraduates have been assisting the director in the running of the 
Frosh IMs program. These undergraduates have been involved with Frosh IMs during their first year here and are in charge of 
much of the day-to-day operation of the program.<br><br> 
 
	<u>Daniel Liss</u><br> 
		Daniel Liss (dliss@fas) is a junior in Cabot House and in his second year on the Frosh IM Staff. Freshman 
year, Daniel proudly represented Grays in all sports but is particularly proud of Grays's championship volleyball squad. He 
is an avid New York sports fan whose favorite team of all time is the 1993-94 New York Knicks.<br><br> 
 
		<u>Neil Curran</u><br> 
		Neil Curran (ncurran@fas) is a sophomore inÂ Quincy House in his first year on the Frosh IM Staff.Â Last 
year,Â Neil was an integralÂ member of Wigglesworth's successful quest of the YardÂ Bucket. Neil is a hardcore SoCal sports 
fan with his allegiances lying with the Lakers, Dodgers, Galaxy, and UCLA Bruins.<br><br> 
		
		<u>Matt Coe-Odess</u><br> 
		Matt Coe-Odess (mcoe@fas) is a sophomore in Kirkland House in his first year on the Frosh IM staff. Matt was 
a proud member of the Thayer Slayers last year, giving his blood, sweat, and tears for his dorm. He is a die-hard sports fan 
and roots for the Yankees, Colts, Bobcats, and Los Angeles Kings, as well as the North Carolina Tar Heels in all college 
sports.<br><br> 
		
		<b>Whom and How to Contact</b><br><br> 
		Each of the undergraduate directors of the Frosh IMs program have certain areas of the program for which 
they are responsible. If you have any questions or suggestions or comments about any facet of the Frosh IMs program you can 
either contact the appropriate undergraduate director, or, preferably, email froshims@fas. An email to froshims@fas will 
most likely be read the quickest and will be passed on to the appropriate director.<br><br> 
		
		You are also welcome to call any of us within reasonable hours, but because many of us are often out of our 
rooms for long stretches of time during the day, email will probably be the best 
way to get a hold of us.<br><br><br></h4> 
 
		<a name="involved"></a><b><h2><u>How to Get Involved in Frosh 
IMs</u></b></h2> 
		<h4 align="justify"> 
		The easiest and most rewarding way to get involved in Frosh IMs is simply to take part in as many events and 
activities as you wish! Participation is the key to the success of this program! However, we also would love to have you 
involved in the organization and leadership of Frosh IMs. In order to get involved in this way, there are many 
opportunities, some of which are detailed below.<br><br><br> 
 
		<b>IM Reps</b><br><br> 
		
		IM Reps are perhaps the most important people for the success of the Frosh IMs program. IM Reps will be the 
liasons between the Frosh IMs program and the Class of 2013. IM Reps are in charge of encouraging and measuring interest in 
each activity within their entryway and coordinating with the other IM Reps from their dorm to register an appropriate 
number of teams for each team sporting event. They are also responsible for informing individuals of individual events so 
that they may register themselves. Basically, the most important role that the IM Reps play is in keeping interested 
individuals within their entryway abreast of what is happening within the Frosh IMs program. This can be done by direct 
communication with entrywaymates or by forwarding the information they recieve from us to their proctor group. IM Reps will 
be expected to attend a couple of meetings during the year with the undergraduate directors to discuss organizational 
matters, but the primary communication between IM Reps and the program will be through email.<br><br> 
 
		IM Reps (2 or 3 from each entryway) are selected at the opening entryway meetings. However, we welcome any 
additional individuals who would like to serve as IM Reps. If you are interested, please just contact the program 
(froshims@fas). A list of IM Reps will appear shortly on the Frosh IMs web page.<br><br><br> 
 
		<b>Frosh IMs Web Page</b><br><br> 
		The focal point of all Frosh IMs information is the Frosh IMs web page located at 
www.fas.harvard.edu/~froshims. On this page you will hopefully find everything you might want to know about the Frosh IMs 
program. The IM Reps will be registering for all of the sports this year from this web page, and you can check out from the 
web page what teams are registered from your dorm.<br><br> 
		
		Also, schedules for all of the events will be posted on the web page as soon as they are prepared, so check 
here to find out when and where your teams are playing. Also, the results from each game played should be posted on the web 
page, ideally within 2 or 3 days of the game. Updated point totals for the Yard Bucket competition will also be available on 
the webpage and these are instantly updated as soon as the results from a game are entered onto the web.<br><br> 
 
		Finally, the Frosh IMs web page will be the site for any announcements regarding the program, especially on 
such topics as cancelled events due to weather, upcoming registrations, new events, etc. Check back often for the latest 
announcements!<br><br> 
 
		The Frosh IMs web page is our most vital link between the Class of 2013 and the Frosh IM program. We hope 
that through it the Frosh IMs program will run as smoothly as possible this year!<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Frosh IMs Mailing List</b><br><br> 
		The Frosh IMs Mailing List is our way of contacting all those interested in the Frosh IM program. If you are 
an IM rep you will be automatically placed on the Frosh IMs mailing list. But if you are not an IM Rep and would like to 
receive email updates about the program, particularly detailing upcoming events and opportunities, then just sign up for the 
Frosh IMs Mailing List at the Frosh IMs web page (www.fas.harvard.edu/~froshims) under the 'How to Get Involved' 
Option.<br><br><br></h4> 
 
		<h2><u><b><a name="how"></a>How We Work</u></b></h2> 
		<h4 align="justify"> 
		Because the Frosh IMs program involves many hundreds of students in the Class of 2013, it can be difficult 
to find a good fit between a smoothly running, efficient program and a program with a personal touch. With the advent of the 
Frosh IMs web page, we have greatly increased efficiency, unfortunately, though, at the price of sacrificing much of the 
interaction that in the past has occurred between the Frosh IMs directors and the participants. Therefore, while maintaining 
the efficiency of the program found in the web page, the staff is making a concerted effort to become more visible through 
IM meetings, running special events, etc. Introduce yourself to us - we will be very happy to put a face with a name and 
email address! And please don't hesitate to contact us about anything - while email is probably the easiest way to get a 
hold of us, we would love to sit down over a meal to discuss the program and just life in general. <br><br> 
 
		This section of the Guide, however, will focus on the logistics of how the Frosh IMs program 
runs.<br><br><br> 
 
		<b>IM Rep Meetings</b><br><br> 
		Once a semester, there will be a meeting of all of the IM Reps. Our introductory fall meeting will be held 
sometime in the first few weeks of September. All IM Reps will receive an e-mail with the time and place, and it will also 
be posted here on our webpage. If you are an IM Rep and cannot attend the meeting, please contact froshims@fas if you have 
any questions. These meetings will give you a chance to put a face to the names of those running the Frosh IMs program and 
will also serve as a time for us to give you an overview of how the program will run and events to look forward to in the 
future. Also, of course, this will be a great chance to have any of your questions answered.<br><br> 
 
		While the meetings are primarily for IM reps and will largely focus upon the logistical side of the running 
of the program, we certainly welcome any interested individuals to come to these meetings.<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Registration</b><br><br> 
		All IM reps and everyone on the Frosh IMs mailing list will receive an email announcing when registrations 
for various IM activities will begin and end. In addition, an annoucement will be posted on the Frosh IMs web page. Each 
dorm is allotted a set number of teams for each team sport (see below for the team allotments and a brief explanation of the 
rationale behind these numbers). Individual sports (such as tennis, racquetball, Charles River Run, etc.) have no limits on 
the number of participants from each dorm and we encourage all those interested to take part.<br><br> 
 
		Because there are only a limited number of teams allowed per dorm, the IM reps for each dorm should be in 
contact with one another whenever reigstrations for team sports begin. Particularly, the IM reps should discuss the amount 
of interest for each sport within their own entryway as well as whether there is anyone in their entryway who might be 
interested in serving as team captain for the sport. While anyone from the dorm may play on a team, an individual may only 
play on one team from a dorm for each sport. In other words, even if Thayer has three volleyball teams, a student must pick 
one volleyball team to play on and remain with that team exclusively throughout the season. For this reason, therefore, we 
suggest that the IM reps, when discussing the interest within their entryways for each sport, decide roughly how the teams 
will be divided up for each sport. For instance, taking Grays as an example, they might decide in ultimate that Grays West 
will field one team for ultimate and Grays East and Middle would field the other team. These divisions are not set in stone, 
but we've found that this is the best way for organizing the teams within each dorm and also leads itself to the building of 
unity within the entryways.<br><br> 
		
		Dorms are not required to field as many teams in each sport as they are allotted. If there is only enough 
interest within a dorm for basketball to field 2 teams, then even if the dorm is allotted 3 teams, they should only field 2. 
This way there will be fewer forfeits and ultimately more net points for the dorm.<br><br> 
 
		Once a registration has been announced and the IM reps have had an opportunity to decide with the other IM 
Reps for the dorm how the teams from their dorm will be distributed, then these teams need to be registered. To register 
teams, select the 'Register' option from the Frosh IMs webpage. From there you will be prompted to select the sport you are 
registering for, the dorm that you represent, and to provide the name of the team (be creative - but decent!), and a team 
captain, along with his or her email and phone number. Before you finalize your registration, you will be shown all of the 
other reigstrations from your dorm so that you can make sure that someone else has not already registered the team.<br><br> 
 
		You can also view the teams registered for each sport from each dorm by selecting the 'Registrants' option 
from the Frosh IMs web page.<br><br> 
		
		In the case of individual sports, either an IM rep can register everyone from their entryway who is 
interested in participating, or else individuals can register themselves. Each individual will receive an email that they 
must respond to in order to confirm their participation in the event.<br><br> 
		
		If you accidentally register a team, wish to change any information, or have any problems, please email 
froshims@fas.<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Number of Teams</b><br><br> 
 
		Perhaps the most annoying part of Frosh IMs is when you and your team are all excited to play a sport, you 
travel down to the fields or to the MAC to play, and then your opponents do not show up! In order to try to reduce the 
number of forfeits that occur during the year, the Frosh IMs program in the past few years have adopted a number of 
different measures, one of which is allotting to each individual dorm a set number of teams for all team events.<br><br> 
 
		From past years we have discovered that a dorm can generally support 1 team in a given sport for every 50 
people in the dorm. For that reason, then, we have allotted to each dorm one team for roughly every 50 students, allowing 
for small fluctuations in the case of small dorms (i.e. a dorm with 25 students still gets a team) and for dorms with 
numbers in between 50s (i.e. a dorm with 110 students would probably be best with 2 teams while a dorm with 140 could 
probably handle 3). These team allotments will be rather strictly enforced, especially at the beginning of the year. If you 
feel like your dorm could field more teams in a particular sport than the number allotted, please contact us and we will 
consider these on an individual basis.<br><br> 
 
		We recognize that setting a maximum on the number of teams that a dorm can field may seem rather strict, but 
we believe that by doing this, many forfeits will be eliminated, allowing ultimately for more fun for everyone.<br><br> 
 
		The team allotments are as follows:<br><br>

		<b>Team Captains</b><br><br> 
		Acting as a team captain for a team in a given sport can also be a great way to get involved in the Frosh 
IMs program. We will email team captains with any annoucements regarding their particular sport, such as cancellations or 
reschedulings due to inclement weather. Team captains primarily serve as the liason between the participants in a particular 
sport and that sport's director. Their basic job is to get a list of all those interested in their particular sport, and let 
everyone on that list know when the games are. Before each game, they should ensure that there are enough participants for 
the game. If there are not, team captains should first try to find additional players from their dorm, and if that fails, 
e-mail froshims@fas as soon as possible. In addition, we hope that team captains will work to rally support for their sport 
within the dorm.
 
		IM Reps may certainly serve as team captains, although we encourage having other interested people serve as 
captains for some sports, as this expands the number of people directly involved with the operation of Frosh IMs in the 
entryway.<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Schedules</b><br><br> 
		After registrations have been confirmed, the schedules for at least the first two weeks of competition will 
be posted on the web page. Team captains, IM Reps, and those on the Frosh IMs Mailing List will be emailed with notification 
of when the schedules are online. Schedules hopefully will be posted at least 3 days prior to the day of play. If you find 
that there is a conflict in one of your scheduled matches such that your team absolutely cannot make the scheduled game, 
please contact us (froshims@fas) as soon as possible and we will try to make alternate arrangements.<br><br><br> 
 
		<b>Forfeits</b><br><br> 
		Teams are expected to arrive and be ready to play at the time that their match is scheduled. There is often 
additional field space or court space where you can warm-up even if there is another IM game going on before your scheduled 
game. Captains' meetings will be held at 5 minutes past the scheduled start time, and the game will begin promptly 10 
minutes after the scheduled start time.<br><br> 
		
		A team can forfeit in one of two ways. If a team has less than half the number of people that can play at 
any time (e.g. 3 for basketball, 3 for volleyball) at the time the game is to begin (10 minutes after the scheduled start 
time), the team will forfeit the game immediately. Players will only be counted if they are present and ready to 
play.<br><br> 
 
		If a team has half or more of the total number of players that can play at a time, but less than the 
required number (see table below), then they are granted a 10 minute extension. The game will begin with the depleted squad, 
and the team must have the required number of players by 20 minutes after the scheduled start time. If the team does not 
have the required number of players, the game will be halted immediately, and a forfeit will be recorded.<br><br> 
 
		If at any time 20 minutes after the start of a game a team does not have the required number of players 
eligible to play (including shortages caused by ejections, but not by injuries), the team will immediately forfeit.<br><br>

		</table><br> 
		
		As an additional way to help decrease the number of forfeits in Frosh IMs, if you forfeit any two games of 
your season, your team will be removed from the remainder of the season.<br><br> 
 
		If you know that you will be unable to field a team for a scheduled contest, it is possible to avoid a 
forfeit. To do so, you must e-mail the opposing captain, froshims@fas, the head officials, and the season coordinator by 
midnight before the game. The opposing team will win by default (they need not show up to the fields), and your team will 
not have any decision recorded on the game (you will neither win nor lose points for the Yard Bucket).<br><br> 
 
		If you wish to reschedule, you must give at least 36 hours notice.<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Playoffs</b><br><br> 
		Most team sport seasons will be followed immediately by a playoff. Playoffs usually involve 8-16 teams, and 
the teams with the best records will make the playoffs. These records will also roughly be used to determine seeding. In 
most cases, playoff schedules will be posted online 3 days prior to the beginning of the playoffs and usually a couple of 
days after the completion of the regular season. The playoffs will be single-elimination.<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Inclement Weather Conditions</b><br><br> 
		In the case that weather should force the cancellation of any IM events, the captains of the events in 
question, as well as IM Reps and those on the Frosh IMs mailing list, will receive an email announcing the cancellations at 
least 30 minutes prior to the beginning of the game. In addition any cancellations will be posted on the Frosh IMs web page 
under announcements. If there is no announcement on this website and you haven't gotten an e-mail saying that the games have 
been cancelled, then the games will be played as scheduled. As field space and mild weather are very limited, often a light 
rain will not cancel games.<br><br><br> 
 
		<b>Who Is Eligible</b><br><br> 
		All sports are open to all frosh men and women unless otherwise specified. However, frosh may not 
participate in the same intramural sports as those in which they play as varsity or sub-varsity athletes. Proctors, 
non-resident advisors, peer advising fellows and assistant deans are also eligible to play for the dorm with which they are 
associated. Please email froshims@fas if you have any questions regarding whether a player is eligible. We want to encourage 
everyone to participate, but we recognize also that much of the enjoyment is taken away for everybody if varsity or junior 
varsity athletes are allowed to compete in their sport. For more detailed eligibility rules, please view the rules page by 
selecting rules at the top of your screen. Please understand that these eligibility rules will be strictly enforced and any 
team using ineligible players will forfeit all games in which the ineligible player participated.<br><br> 
		
		As an added rule this year, any player caught playing illegally (either for another dorm or a team other 
than the one he/she originally played on) will not only cause that team to forfeit, but will also be ineligible to play IMs 
in that sport for that season.<br><br> 
		
		For a more detailed Eligibility rule, check our rules page.<br><br><br> 
 
		<b>Yard Bucket Competition</b><br><br> 
		The Yard Bucket is awarded each year to the dorm that accumulates the highest total points during the year. 
This year, during regular season play, points will be awarded in the following ratio: <br><br> 
		
		Win: 20 points <br> 
		Loss: 10 points  <br> 
		Forfeit: -15 points <br><br> 
		
		Therefore, you can see that the emphasis is placed more heavily upon participating in the event rather than 
winning and losing. The dorm that wins the Yard Bucket competition each year is often the dorm that has forfeited the 
least.<br><br> 
		
		For individual tournaments and special events (like the Charles River Run) points will also be allotted in a 
similar manner, with full details being given prior to the start of each event. For these events as well, though, the 
emphasis will be upon participation.<br><br> 
		
		In order to account for the fact that some dorms are larger than others and can field more teams, the final 
total for each dorm will be calculated by normalizing the number of teams allotted. The actual numbers used to normalize 
involve cubed roots and fibonacci numbers, or so it seems, but it does follow that smaller dorms get over two times more 
points for a win or loss than a larger dorm would. For team sports, small dorms are multiplied by 2.5, medium dorms are 
multiplied by 1.5, and large dorms aren't multiplied by anything. For example, since Mower has 1 allotted team, Mower's 
score will be multiplied by 2.5 to determine its final point total.<br><br> 
		
		Individual events are weighted according to a normalized scale based on the actual number of people in the 
dorm. The smallest dorm, Mass Hall, with 24 people is multiplied by 4 for individual events, and Canaday, the largest dorm, 
is multiplied by 1. Other dorms are somewhere in between these two multipliers. For more details, see the FAQ's 
page.<br><br> 
		
		The up-to-the minute point totals and standings in the Yard Bucket Competition can be viewed at the Frosh 
IMs web page under point tallies.<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Behavior</b><br><br> 
		You are expected to abide by the rules set forth by the University when engaging in IM play. Any 
fights/incidents occurring during intramural activities will be subject to disciplinary action by the Ad Board. In addition 
the referees have the authority to remove anyone acting inappropriately from any IM game and such action could result in 
suspension from that team or even from the entire program. The Frosh IMs program is supposed to be fun - please work to make 
sure that it stays that way!<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Suggestions</b><br><br> 
		This is your program! We strongly welcome and encourage any suggestions you might have about how the program 
can be made better and provide more fun for you! We particular welcome suggestions for new activities the Frosh IMs program 
can offer! Please send any suggestions you have to

		<a name="calendar"></a><h2><b><u>Calendar of Events</u></b></h2> 
		
		<h4 align="justify"> 
		Below is a very rough sketch of what will be offered this year for the freshman intramural program. The 
dates are always subject to change, and events may be added or deleted based on space, time, and interest. This list is 
simply our tentative plan for the year. Specific sport offerings are subject to change due to field limitations and 
suggestions from you! Also listed are basic descriptions of each sport offered. More detailed rules can be obtained from our 
website via the rules page.<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Fall Sports<br><br></b> 
		The fall sports will begin in mid-September and conclude prior to Thanksgiving Break. The specific starting 
times for the events will be announced later, but in general the field sports will begin first, with the indoor sports 
beginning a number of weeks later.<br><br> 
		
		<u>Ultimate Frisbee</u><br> 
		Although we often have to contend with temperamental winds, ultimate Frisbee is great fun and good exercise. 
The format for ultimate is two twenty minute halves with running time. Officials may stop time if the disk flies a long 
distance out of bounds. This is a seven-a-side game, but a game may begin with a minimum of five players per team. Standard 
ultimate rules apply; they will be discussed by the officials before the game.<br><br> 
		
		<u>Soccer</u><br> 
		We play two 20-minute halves with seven players per side. Teams must have a minimum of five players to avoid 
a forfeit. Games are played on a field just beyond the Palmer Dixon Tennis Courts. Nets, game ball, and officials are 
provided. Standard NCAA soccer rules are enforced.<br><br> 
		
		<u>Flag Football</u><br> 
		Six players represent each team. Game may start when 5 are present. The game consists of four quarters of 
twelve plays each, divided into two halves. Teams will have five downs to score a touchdown. Complete rules can be found in 
the House Athletics Rule Book.<br><br> 
		
		<u>Charles River Run</u><br> 
		The Charles River Run is a 1.7 mile cross-country style race that takes place twice a year. The course 
begins at Newell Boathouse, goes around the Eliot-Anderson Bridge loop, finishing again at Newell. Everyone is welcome to 
join the Race - both seasoned runners and occasional joggers have turned out in the past versions of this classic. The River 
Run is one of the more popular events of the year, drawing a large portion of the freshman class. Intramural points are 
awarded for all participants; top finishers receive additional points for their dorm.<br><br> 
 
		<u>Individual Tournaments</u><br> 
		Individual tournaments work slightly different than regular team sports. Individuals will be paired to play 
each other and given a deadline by which to play their match. They can then schedule the match at a mutually convenient 
time. We hope to run at least one tournament a season. In the past we have done Squash, Pool, Chess, Ping-Pong, Foosball and 
others. We are always open to new suggestions so if there is something you want to play let us know!<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Winter Sports</b><br><br> 
		Winter sports, with the exception of ice hockey, start in December and continue until spring break.<br><br> 
		
		<U>A-League / B-League Basketball</u><br> 
		Basketball has proven to be the most popular of the IM sports over the past few years. In an effort to make 
it fun for as many people as possible, this year we divide basketball into two leagues. The A-league is for the teams who 
want some serious competition and is definitely the place for a team with some former high school varsity basketball stars. 
For frosh who are trying basketball for the first time and don't want a 6-foot five guy stuffing their every shot, the 
B-league might be more fun. Both leagues play by traditional rules: this is five-a-side, full-court basketball played in two 
20-minute halves. The clock runs continuously until the final three minutes of the second half at which point stop-time goes 
into effect. A bonus free-throw is awarded after the seventh team foul in each half, and two shots are granted for fouls 
committed during the last three minutes of the game. There are no limits on personal fouls, but referees are given authority 
to boot players who abuse this allowance or who choose violent play over finesse. Teams are permitted three time-outs per 
game. We would naturally prefer that teams arrive with five players plus some reserves, but we will allow a squad to play 
with a minimum of four players.<br><br> 
		
		<u>Ice Hockey</u><br> 
		Each year we pull together an all-frosh Intramural Ice Hockey team. The frosh team participates in the House 
Intramural League, and has succeeded in bringing the championship back to the yard. The 8 or 10 occasional practices are 
held at Bright Hockey Center. You need not have had much or any hockey experience in order to play, although this it is not 
recommended for non-skaters to play. We have a minimal reserve of hockey equipment. More information on what is available 
will be provided as the season approaches. We do provide helmets and pucks. Games are supervised by experienced referees and 
are attended by and athletic trainer. Good sportsmanship is expected; dangerous play will not be tolerated. Games are 
scheduled during weekday evenings and include ten minutes of warm-up and two 25 minute periods.<br><br> 
 
		<u>Dodgeball</u><br> 
		A relatively new addition to Frosh IMs, dodgeball has quickly become one of the most popular IM sports. We 
play dodgeball in the MAC, in teams of six a side. Games last until one team is eliminated and matches are best of three 
games. Official rules are provided by the NADA, and are available at www.dodgeballusa.com/rules.html.<br><br> 
 
		<u>Individual Tournaments</u><br> 
		Individual tournaments work slightly different than regular team sports. Individuals will be paired to play 
each other and given a deadline by which to play their match. They can then schedule the match at a mutually convenient 
time. We hope to run at least one tournament a season. In the past we have done Squash, Pool, Chess, Ping-Pong, Foosball and 
others. We are always open to new suggestions so if there is something you want to play let us know!<br><br> 
 
		<u>Triathalon</u><br> 
		The triathalon will be an intense test of courage and athletic prowess. It will be held in the MAC, and will 
consist of treadmill running, biking, and swimming in the indoor pool. Each event will be timed, and scores will be based on 
distance traveled within time limits.<br><br><br> 
		
		<b>Spring Sports</b><br><br> 
		The spring sports will take place following Spring Break. The specific starting times for the events will be 
announced later.<br><br> 
		
		<u>Volleyball</u><br> 
		An overwhelmingly popular evening diversion, this sport is played at the MAC. Although NCAA rules provide 
the guidelines for play, some rules are relaxed for practical reasons. The referee will explain the rules before each match 
which consists of two out of three games to 20 points using rally scoring. At least four members of each team must be 
present for play to begin, but as many as six players may be on the court for each team at a time, with substitutions being 
allowed.<br><br> 
		
		<u>Ultimate Frisbee</U></br> 
		Although we often have to contend with temperamental winds, ultimate Frisbee is great fun and good exercise. 
The format for ultimate is two twenty minute halves with running time. Officials may stop time if the disk flies a long

		<u>Tennis Tournament</u><br> 
		Due to popular demand, Tennis is back this year, but we still have to work out the details. More information 
on this soon.<br><br><br></h4> 
 
		<a name="refs"></a><h2><b><u>Referees</u></b></h2> 
		<h4 align="justify"> 
		Referees for all Frosh and House intramural games are provided by the Intramural Reffing Program which is 
made up of all Harvard students and is under the guidance of the Athletic Department. The reffing program is a great way to 
get more involed with IMs and to make a few bucks without having to clean toilets. If you are interested in becoming a 
referee, contact the head ref, whose e-mail can be found on the Contact Us page. We are always looking for new refs and no 
reffing experience is required.<br><br><br><br></h4>
